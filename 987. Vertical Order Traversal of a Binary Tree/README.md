Given the root of a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position (x, y), its left and right children respectively will be at positions (x - 1, y - 1) and (x + 1, y - 1).

Running a vertical line from x = -∞ to x = +∞, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing y coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.

Return a list of non-empty reports in order of x coordinate. Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation: Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation: The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.
